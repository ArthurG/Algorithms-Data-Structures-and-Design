Cover vertical line case in intersection
Complete powerSet
Do second part of magicIndex
Do the bit version of numberSwapper

complete shortest super sequence

Sieve of Eratoshenes Algo -> Write this algo out for prime number generation4

Do the heavypill challenge

Do dominoes

Do sortedMerge <- Really easy and quicks

remove datastructure implementations in files for algos not related directly to those datastructures:
-RouteBetweenNodes stack

-isUnique <- Pls implement a set class first thanks

Fix in place merge sort

figure out benefits of 2 stack implementation of queue
FIX THE QUEUE DATASTRUCTURE SO IT WORKS THANKS -> once done finish routeBetweenNodes

Complete Interval Coloring


change quicksort to inplace quicksort
fix quickselect and learn how to do inplace partitioning



DONE ############################################

NOT GOING TO DO ###############################

COOL STUFF #######################################

Research BFS VS DFS VS BiDirectional Search
RouteBetweenNodes goes over all graph search algo implementations => FIX DFS ALGO SO IT MATCHES THE TIMINGS IN THE ALGO NOTES FOR START AND FINISH

Hash Table Collision Resolution:
    Chaining with linked lists
    Chaining with Binary Search Trees
    Open Addressing with Linear Probing
    Quadratic Probing and Double Hashing
Robin Karp Substring Search
AVL Trees
